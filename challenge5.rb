# Start with an array of travel destinations. Print every travel destination in alphabetical order 
# embedded in a sentence using string interpolation. For example, if the destination is "New York City", 
# print something like "The next place I want to visit is New York City!"

# 1. I need to make a program that takes an array of the names of places, then print the names
# in a string that says something about the city. (in alphabetical order)
# 2. i will alphabetize the array. i will use string interpolation most likely to print the output string, 
# after an iteration over the array which will pass each place as an argument into a phrase.
